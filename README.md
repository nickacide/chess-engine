# JS Chess Engine `v1.0.0`
A simple chess engine coded in native JavaScript.
# Goals
- NodeJS and terminal integration (to comply with uci standards)
- Accurate position evaluator (No 3rd party evaluators allowed)
- Neat Chess UI to go with using the chess engine
- Heavy optimization in the far future (if a rewrite in another language isn't done)

I want the chess engine to match my playing style. That probably means I'm going to have to feed it neural network shit. (Providing it with the openings I play simply won't cut it really.)
